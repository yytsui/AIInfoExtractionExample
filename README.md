A project demonstrates how to extract structured information from natural language documents using AI and further organize and enhance it.

The sample text used is from the [1919 cookbook compilation "Original Recipes of Good Things to Eat"](https://ia601303.us.archive.org/34/items/originalrecipeso00orde/originalrecipeso00orde.pdf). 

The final results of information extraction and AI-generated images are presented in this [example](https://yytsui.github.io/notes/gen_recipes_markdown/r117/).
